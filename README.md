# Task 2 (churn)
# PhoneNow Customer Retention Dashboard

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard created for PhoneNow to analyze customer retention metrics. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) that help the retention manager understand customer behavior, service usage, and account details to improve retention strategies.

## Project Details

### Data Sources
The dashboard is built using the following data inputs provided by the Retention Manager:
- **Customer Churn Data**: Customers who left within the last month.
- **Service Usage**: Information on the services each customer has signed up for, including:
  - Phone
  - Multiple lines
  - Internet
  - Online security
  - Online backup
  - Device protection
  - Tech support
  - Streaming TV and movies
- **Customer Account Information**: Details such as:
  - Duration as a customer
  - Contract type
  - Payment method
  - Paperless billing status
  - Monthly charges
  - Total charges
  - Number of tickets opened (administrative and technical)
- **Demographic Information**: Gender, age range, partner status, and dependents.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Define KPIs**: Identify and define the key performance indicators relevant to customer retention.
2. **Create Dashboard**: Develop a Power BI dashboard that visually represents these KPIs.
3. **Insights & Recommendations**: Analyze the data to derive actionable insights and suggest improvements.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The KPIs included in the dashboard are:
- **Customer Churn Rate**: Percentage of customers who left within the last month.
- **Service Usage Analysis**: Breakdown of services used by retained vs. churned customers.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Average revenue generated by a customer over their lifetime.
- **Ticket Analysis**: Number of tickets opened by customers, categorized by administrative and technical issues.
- **Demographic Segmentation**: Customer distribution by gender, age range, and family status (partners and dependents).

### Dashboard Description
The Power BI dashboard provides the following insights:
- **Churn Overview**: Visual representation of the churn rate and its trends over time.
- **Service Utilization**: Analysis of the services that churned customers were subscribed to versus retained customers.
- **Revenue Analysis**: A view of monthly charges, total charges, and their correlation with churn rates.
- **Ticket Trends**: Insights into the types and number of tickets opened, categorized by issue type.
- **Demographic Insights**: Demographic segmentation of the customer base, highlighting factors contributing to churn.

### Findings & Recommendations
An email template has been prepared to communicate the findings to the engagement partner. Below is a brief summary of the insights:

**Key Findings:**
- Customers with a high number of technical tickets have a higher churn rate.
- Churn rates are higher among customers who subscribe to fewer services.
- Younger customers and those without dependents show a higher tendency to churn.

**Recommendations:**
- Enhance technical support to reduce the number of technical issues.
- Introduce bundled service offers to encourage customers to subscribe to multiple services.
- Implement targeted retention strategies for younger customers and those without dependents.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Power BI Desktop installed on your local machine.
   - Access to the PhoneNow data (ensure you have the appropriate permissions).

2. **Open the Power BI File**:
   - Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
   - Load the provided data sources.
   - Refresh the data to see the latest insights.

3. **Explore the Dashboard**:

# Task 3 (Task4)
# Employee Metrics Analysis with Power BI
## Project Overview

This Power BI project is focused on analyzing employee metrics related to hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover. The goal is to define and visualize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to identify trends and possible root causes of slow progress in these areas.

## Objectives

- **Define relevant KPIs** in the areas of hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover.
- **Create visualizations** that effectively communicate the trends and insights related to these KPIs.
- **Identify potential root causes** for any slow progress observed in the data.

## KPIs to be Calculated

### Hiring
- **# of Men Hired**: The total number of male employees hired in the fiscal year.
- **# of Women Hired**: The total number of female employees hired in the fiscal year.
- **% of Hires (Men)**: The percentage of total hires that are men.
- **% of Hires (Women)**: The percentage of total hires that are women.

### Promotion
- **% Employees Promoted (FY21)**: The percentage of total employees who were promoted in FY21.
- **% of Women Promoted**: The percentage of total female employees who were promoted.
  
### Performance
- **Average Performance Rating (Men)**: The average performance rating of male employees.
- **Average Performance Rating (Women)**: The average performance rating of female employees.

### Turnover
- **# of Leavers**: The total number of employees who left the organization.
- **% Turnover**: The percentage of total employees who left the organization.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations will be created in Power BI to represent the calculated KPIs:

1. **Bar Chart**: Comparing the number of men vs. women hired, promoted, and left the organization.
2. **Line Chart**: Showing trends in % of hires and promotions over time, segmented by gender.
3. **Pie Chart**: Distribution of turnover by gender.
4. **KPI Cards**: Displaying % of employees promoted, % of hires (men and women), and average performance ratings for men and women.
5. **Heat Map**: Highlighting areas with the highest turnover rates and lowest performance ratings.

## Analysis & Root Cause Identification

Based on the visualizations, the following potential root causes for slow progress in the areas of hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover may be identified:

1. **Gender Bias in Hiring & Promotion**: Discrepancies in the hiring and promotion percentages between men and women could indicate potential biases or structural issues in the recruitment and promotion processes.
  
2. **Performance Rating Disparities**: Significant differences in the average performance ratings of men and women might suggest issues related to performance evaluation criteria or biases in performance reviews.

3. **High Turnover Rates**: High turnover rates, particularly among a specific gender, may indicate dissatisfaction, lack of growth opportunities, or workplace culture issues.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop.
2. Review the visualizations and KPIs.
3. Use the insights to identify areas for improvement in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover processes.

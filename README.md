- **Calls by Time**: Visualizes the distribution of calls over different time intervals.
- **Average Speed of Answer**: Shows the average time taken to answer incoming calls.
- **Agentâ€™s Performance Quadrant**: Compares agents' average handle time (talk duration) against the number of calls answered, categorizing them into performance quadrants.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this dashboard includes information on customer interactions, agent performance, call logs, and customer feedback. The data has been pre-processed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## Dashboard Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Filter and drill down into specific data points for more granular insights.
- **Customizable Views**: Adjust the time frame and metrics displayed according to your needs.
- **Agent Performance Analysis**: Identify top-performing and underperforming agents based on key metrics.
- **Real-Time Data**: The dashboard is designed to support real-time data updates, ensuring up-to-date insights.

# Task 2 (churn)
# PhoneNow Customer Retention Dashboard

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard created for PhoneNow to analyze customer retention metrics. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) that help the retention manager understand customer behavior, service usage, and account details to improve retention strategies.

## Project Details

### Data Sources
The dashboard is built using the following data inputs provided by the Retention Manager:
- **Customer Churn Data**: Customers who left within the last month.
- **Service Usage**: Information on the services each customer has signed up for, including:
  - Phone
  - Multiple lines
  - Internet
  - Online security
  - Online backup
  - Device protection
  - Tech support
  - Streaming TV and movies
- **Customer Account Information**: Details such as:
  - Duration as a customer
  - Contract type
  - Payment method
  - Paperless billing status
  - Monthly charges
  - Total charges
  - Number of tickets opened (administrative and technical)
- **Demographic Information**: Gender, age range, partner status, and dependents.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Define KPIs**: Identify and define the key performance indicators relevant to customer retention.
2. **Create Dashboard**: Develop a Power BI dashboard that visually represents these KPIs.
3. **Insights & Recommendations**: Analyze the data to derive actionable insights and suggest improvements.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The KPIs included in the dashboard are:
- **Customer Churn Rate**: Percentage of customers who left within the last month.
- **Service Usage Analysis**: Breakdown of services used by retained vs. churned customers.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Average revenue generated by a customer over their lifetime.
- **Ticket Analysis**: Number of tickets opened by customers, categorized by administrative and technical issues.
- **Demographic Segmentation**: Customer distribution by gender, age range, and family status (partners and dependents).

### Dashboard Description
The Power BI dashboard provides the following insights:
- **Churn Overview**: Visual representation of the churn rate and its trends over time.
- **Service Utilization**: Analysis of the services that churned customers were subscribed to versus retained customers.
- **Revenue Analysis**: A view of monthly charges, total charges, and their correlation with churn rates.
- **Ticket Trends**: Insights into the types and number of tickets opened, categorized by issue type.
- **Demographic Insights**: Demographic segmentation of the customer base, highlighting factors contributing to churn.

### Findings & Recommendations
An email template has been prepared to communicate the findings to the engagement partner. Below is a brief summary of the insights:

**Key Findings:**
- Customers with a high number of technical tickets have a higher churn rate.
- Churn rates are higher among customers who subscribe to fewer services.
- Younger customers and those without dependents show a higher tendency to churn.

**Recommendations:**
- Enhance technical support to reduce the number of technical issues.
- Introduce bundled service offers to encourage customers to subscribe to multiple services.
- Implement targeted retention strategies for younger customers and those without dependents.
